# Web Application Penetration Testing

This a report that I submitted for a class assignment after carrying out penetration tests on a fictious web application, the Enders & Yang Bank application. The report starts with a summary containing the tools, the test objectives, and the critical issues that were discovered after carrying out the tests. The next session after the summary gives a detailed breakdown on each of the penetration tests that was carried out. The `web-app-pentest.md` file contains this report.

The web application's server runs Windows 2003 server OS, which is contained in virtual appliance file uploaded to this project. Burp Suite Community edition was used to carry out the penetration tests.
